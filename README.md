This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is a practice web application built to review and reinforce my understanding of Next.js fundamentals.

Reusable components: The Header and Hero components show how to build and reuse UI pieces in Next.js.

Routing and layout: Uses the new Next.js App Router (app/ folder) with a shared layout and navigation links.

Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS for easy and responsive styling, and cleans up unused CSS to keep things simple and organized.
